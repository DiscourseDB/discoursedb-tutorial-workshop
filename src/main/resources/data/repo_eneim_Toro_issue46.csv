Actually, it uses the original MediaPlayer to play the media content, so it depends on how that MediaPlayer API works. Actually I don't think MediaPlayer eager to download your entire video, but if you can give me a cue for that, I can investigate the behavior.

In the mean time, you can take a look at ExoPlayer and a library name [ExoMedia](https://github.com/brianwernick/ExoMedia) which is created on top of ExoPlayer. I'm going to have the same think as first class supported player in Toro, just could not tell about the release date.",,,api.github.com,,false,"[""https://github.com/brianwernick/ExoMedia""]",[],"[""@chetanurmaliya""]",[]
