issue_title,54,eneim,Toro,pawankumar01,2016-06-07 16:56:05+00:00,"Hi @eneim As suggested by you, I tried implementing using ExoMedia and ToroPlayer both. 
I have activity which have tabs. In the first tab, I have Fragment1 which have toro video implementation and it works fine. However in my fifth tab, I have nested fragment which have toro video implementation. It does not trigger playback. 

Any idea how to resolve issue nested fragment issue ?

Thanks,

issue_comment,54,eneim,Toro,pawankumar01,2016-06-10 08:52:39+00:00,"@eneim, Thanks for quick reply. I am not using ViewPager. I am actually showing and hiding the fragments(Fragment1, Fragment2, Fragment3, Fragment4, Fragment5) using FragmentManager. In my last tab I show a Fragment5 and hides rest of them on user action.
My Fragment5 contains Fragment1 as nested fragment as well.  So this nested fragment do not trigger playback. Hope my language is not so confusing.

The other issue I noticed if Activity have some view above fragment. Let say imageView and fragment in the same layout. ImageView on top occupy 200dp space and then Fragment starts, then visible area offset do not work properly.
