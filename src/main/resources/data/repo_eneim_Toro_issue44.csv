In side recycler view video can be in different dimension. So I don't want to restrict the ToroVideoView to particular height. I just want to specify the maximum height of the ToroVideoView.

At the mean time, I suggest to try my another library which is a tiny implementation of Video view: [FloppyVideoView](https://github.com/eneim/FloppyVideoView). It has a fancy way to work with Video size, and give you ScaleType just like ImageView. I provide an example using Toro (a SNAPSHOT, sorry), so please give it a try and give feedback. I will wrap up and improve Toro in next release soon.",,,api.github.com,,false,"[""https://github.com/eneim/FloppyVideoView""]",[],"[""@chetanurmaliya""]",[]
