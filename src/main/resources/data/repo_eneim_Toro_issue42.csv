We have a recycler view which auto displays videos. On list item click we go to another detail activity which continues to display the same video. Now when we close the detail activity and come back to list view, we want that video to resume from a specified video position (basically the position of video where the detailed activity stopped). 
We are trying to use Seekto(msec) in ToroVideoViewHolder callback methods. But it is playing the video from beginning.

It would be great if you can let us know of a work around. We can override a method if required. We want the video playing feature similar to what is there in Facebook.",,,api.github.com,,false,[],[],[],[]
issue_comment,42,eneim,Toro,eneim,2016-05-12 08:16:32+00:00,Right now create a custom VideoPlayerManager (by implementing VideoPlayerManager interface to your Adapter) could be a work around.

Unfortunately, current version of Toro need to improved (which I already made on this branch) so it's impossible for you to mimic the behaviour with official release.
