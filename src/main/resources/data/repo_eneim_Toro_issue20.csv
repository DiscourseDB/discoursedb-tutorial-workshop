issue_title,20,eneim,Toro,gouravd,2016-03-07 18:16:38+00:00,"Sorry if the answer is obvious as I just started testing this library today. 

I am working with a fullscreen horizontal scrolling recyclerview where only 1 item is visible at any time. It can only be scrolled in one direction (from right to left). I would like to do few operations on items that have been scrolled past (i.e scrolled outside the visible area, like update db that it has been viewed, or delete from db, add analytics for the view etc..).

I was wondering if I could any of the TORO methods/helpers or if there are any callbacks which I can use to do the operations once the items are invisible after being visible.",start issue,Any callbacks for knowing when an item in Recyclerview is active,api.github.com,,false,[],[],[],[]

Currently I am planning to use ListView-Visibility-Utils from danylovolokh/VideoPlayerManager which provides the methods that I would need. But if simillar calbacks are available in Toro, I can get rid of that extra library.",,,api.github.com,,false,[],[],[],[]
