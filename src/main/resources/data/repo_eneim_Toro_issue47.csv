Any update regarding this problem ? 
it's strange because some time it's working but sometimes i am having black screen. like i can see the video information like title,etc. but video is not playing and giving below error,

W/MediaPlayer: Couldn't open file on client side; trying server side: java.io.FileNotFoundException: No content provider: /data/user/0/com.example.test/files/media/m_4083661.mp4
05-25 12:56:41.841 22929-22929/com.example.test W/MediaPlayer: setScreenOnWhilePlaying(true) is ineffective without a SurfaceHolder

In my code,
in the **bind** method of viewholder, 
mVideoView.setVideoURI(Uri.parse(mItem.getFile().getAbsolutePath()));

I am setting path of the file from the local file system.

Let me know if you need more information.

[And this one](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/android-developers/I3L6-xvdcHQ).

It seems that this is either an issue of MediaPlayer class.

FYI I'm working on a new version which is built on top of ExoPlayer. So hopefully It could solve your problems better.

Using it for local file is the right way I guess. Hm using ```Uri.parse(someUrl)``` is used in various places, I will try to figure out how could it help me.
