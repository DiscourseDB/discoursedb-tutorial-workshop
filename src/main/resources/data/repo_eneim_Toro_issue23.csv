It is unable to cancel last requested video from top position and  and previous top and current top both video play simultaneously.

This issue occur only when if request make to play and immediate scroll to another/next item/video in the list.

I have made changes in the library code to play video until 51% of top  view/video is visible on the screen/viewport (In MyHolder class). 

````
@Override public boolean wantsToPlay() {
        Rect childRect = new Rect();
        itemView.getGlobalVisibleRect(childRect, new Point());
        // wants to play if user could see at lease 0.51 of video
        return childRect.height() > mVideoView.getHeight() * 0.51
                && childRect.width() > mVideoView.getWidth() * 0.51;
    }
```

    @Override
    public float visibleAreaOffset() {
        Rect videoRect = getVideoRect();
        Rect parentRect = getRecyclerViewRect();
        if (parentRect != null /*&& !parentRect.contains(videoRect) && !parentRect.intersect(videoRect)*/) {
            return 0f;
        }
        float area = videoRect.height() * videoRect.width();
        float viewArea = getVideoView().getWidth() * getVideoView().getHeight();

I believe that it could fix various issues including yours. But since I could not test all the case (which even UI testing couldn't), so it would be nice if you take a look and give some feedback. I would make a release base on current branch though.

You can get latest SNAPSHOT from develop by using this:

```compile 'com.github.eneim:Toro:develop-SNAPSHOT'```

I want to know one thing about your library. Is this library expired or 
removed from Git-hub after sometime/ year?.  If Yes, then suggest me an 
alternate solution/option for this library project.


Thanks

issue_comment,23,eneim,Toro,mahesh2015,2016-04-12 11:29:25+00:00,"Hi Nam,
I am facing one more problem in Toro Lib i,e.
 If i am using frame Layout and i have two or more view as shown in screen shot.( bottom of the page are tab Buttons after tapping on these buttons, views are changed (add/removed ) from Frame layout).
My problem is that
After start of the application.
1 .First time when View is opened it play wrong video(2nd item) as in screen shot .
2. And Second problem is After next visit to this view does not play any video in list (until list does not scrolled ).

I am using this strategy
        Toro.init(this);
        Toro.setStrategy(Toro.Strategies.FIRST_PLAYABLE_TOP_DOWN);
please suggest some idea. ASAP

I have registered and unregistered as on add  and remove event in  frame layout.
But did not Resolved the issue.
Please let me know one this how can i play a video of a particular index in the list. without affecting other feature/functionality .",,,api.github.com,,false,[],[],[],[]
issue_comment,23,eneim,Toro,eneim,2016-04-13 07:18:31+00:00,"@mahesh2015 , to be able to move further, let me explain how things work now:

- When you setup your RecyclerView, and bring it up and running, your Videos are prepared ***asynchronously***. (If not, I suspect a performance issue).

- After that preparing process finished, the callback ```ToroPlayer#onVideoPrepared()``` got called. From there, *Toro* will listen to that event and trigger the first playback.

Since the prepare process is different for Videos, *there is no guarantee that your Video on top is prepared FIRST and therefore there are chances It is not the first Video to play.*

- When your RecyclerView is back from ***savedInstanceState*** (which is available ***only*** if you properly set it up. For example, following Activity or Fragment's life-cycle). Adding/Removing the view manually by calling ```FrameLayout#addView(View)``` may not maintain your Instance, that't why the second time you add it, it may not work properly.

Actually I hope that re-register it to Toro after you re-add it to your FrameLayout would trigger it to play. Please confirm this point: *After you re-add RecyclerView to your FrameLayout, and re-register it to Toro, your Video playback IS triggered, it's just not in proper order*. <-- Please confirm this. If even you re-register it, no Video plays, then I need to look further for this issue.

It is not playing any video either right to wrong.",,,api.github.com,,false,[],[],[],[]
issue_comment,23,eneim,Toro,eneim,2016-04-13 08:00:06+00:00,"Thanks. So for your first issue, the following Strategy could improve the behaviour:

```java
public static ToroStrategy WORK_AROUND_STRATEGY = new ToroStrategy() {
    boolean isFirstPlayerPrepared = false;

    @Override public String getDescription() {
      return ""Start from first Video"";
    }

    @Override public ToroPlayer findBestPlayer(List<ToroPlayer> candidates) {
      return Toro.Strategies.FIRST_PLAYABLE_TOP_DOWN.findBestPlayer(candidates);
    }

    @Override public boolean allowsToPlay(ToroPlayer player, ViewParent parent) {
      if (player.getPlayOrder() == 0) {
        isFirstPlayerPrepared = true;
      }
      return isFirstPlayerPrepared && Toro.Strategies.FIRST_PLAYABLE_TOP_DOWN.allowsToPlay(player,
          parent);
    }
  };
```

The trick is to return your preferred play order over ```ToroPlayer#getPlayOrder``` and listen to it to raise a flag indicate that your very First Video is prepared. (You should define your ""First Video"" yourself).

I'm using the default ```Toro.Strategies.FIRST_PLAYABLE_TOP_DOWN```, but surely you can replace it with whichever ***Default*** Strategy you prefer. Or carefully use it with your custom one.

For the second issue (after re-adding your View to FrameLayout, it stops playing), I will need a bit more time. Thanks for co-operate.",,,api.github.com,,false,[],[],"[""@Override""]",[]
