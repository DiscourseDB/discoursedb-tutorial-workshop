issue_title,25,aaren,notedown,asimjalis,2015-08-11 23:38:46+00:00,"It would be nice to have a ""--match indented"". In other words, the opposite of ""--match fenced"". 

Benefits are:

1. Easy to indicate syntax of non-executable code (using fencing) so IPYN syntax highlighting can work.

2. Easy to distinguish executable vs non-executable code.",start issue,Option --match not-fenced,api.github.com,,false,[],[],[],[]
issue_comment,25,aaren,notedown,aaren,2015-08-12 07:27:00+00:00,So `notedown --match indented` would only execute indented code and would leave fenced code as-is in a markdown cell?,,,api.github.com,,false,[],[],[],[]
issue_comment,25,aaren,notedown,aaren,2015-08-12 07:29:30+00:00,"You can already do `notedown --match strict`, which requires executed code to have `.input` in the classes, e.g.

    ```
    not executed

    executed
