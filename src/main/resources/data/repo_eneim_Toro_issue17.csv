issue_title,17,eneim,Toro,brittonjg,2016-03-02 11:46:23+00:00,"Hi,

Thanks for the great library. I have been trying to implement this on a recommendation from a different library (FastAdapter), but I have noticed a couple of issues. I can post these a separate issues if required.

1. **Playback off screen** with a ViewPager - I have managed to combat that before with `setUserVisibleHint` from the Fragment. Although I am not sure how you would do this with your implementation yet
2. **Playback off screen** whilst scrolling - If you scroll the play video off the screen, but then scroll very slightly whilst keeping it off the visible screen you can still hear the video playing even though it isn't visible. It seems like the visibility calculator isn't catching it for some reason. Either that or one of the next videos isn't switching from its Prepared state
3. **Looping** - I notice you have this kind of setup in the Toro strategies. When will this become available? I want to loop the videos continuously, but know when they have stopped before they loop again. Or should this be done when `onPlaybackStopped` is called, but you don't have access to a MediaPlayer, so I'm not sure how to loop back around.

All of these points I can replicate in the supplied demo application. I am using very short content â‰ˆ8 seconds long, with sounds. Hence why I noticed some of these issues.

I am testing this on an Nexus 5 running Android 5.0 using Toro 1.1.0.",start issue,Playback inconsistencies,api.github.com,,false,[],[],[],[]
issue_comment,17,eneim,Toro,eneim,2016-03-02 13:37:12+00:00,"Hi @brittonjg . Thanks for your detailed issue. I would like to response each point :D

1. Yeah ViewPager is a pain. I'm thinking of using GlobalFocusChangedListener to catch the ""in-screen"" RecyclerView. There is 2 points here: first - it is said that the ViewTreeObserver retrieved from view.getViewTreeObserver() is not always alive. second - Google's Youtube Player API use the same thing in between the onAttachToWindow and onDetachFromWindow. So I think this could solve the problem.

2. This is maybe my fault. I will investigate.

3. I want to research a little bit more. But in the meantime, it seems that loop playback is highly requested. I would try to do something in next release soon.

Hopefully 1.2.0 will come with the support for ViewPager's page changes and loop playback. So stay tune :D. Thanks for using this again. And please feel free to report whatever issue you have.",,,api.github.com,,false,[],[],"[""@brittonjg""]",[]

Excellent news! Are you looking at days, weeks or longer for that release? I can always do some more investigation if it would help?

I'd be very greatful if you could have a look at it. If we can correct these last little bits I would be much happier just going with your library.

Edit- This is correct as you're looking for the parents `getGlobalVisibleRect` my search continues.

It would seem, that because I have some text under the video. The code seems to be restarting the video, that is off screen. I am going to try and replicate on your sample app.

Okay, that is easier to replicate than I imagined. Replace the below into your layout `vh_toro_video_simple`. Now scroll down, so the video is out of video, but the text is in view.
